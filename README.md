## 🔍 Overview

This project aims to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on health attributes such as:

- Pregnancies  
- Insulin Level  
- Age  
- BMI  
- Glucose  
- Blood Pressure  
- Diabetes Pedigree Function  
- Skin Thickness  

A **Machine Learning–based web application** that predicts the risk of diabetes based on health parameters such as Glucose level, BMI, Age, Blood Pressure, etc.  
This project includes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model training, and web deployment using Django**.


## 🎯 Motivation

Diabetes is one of the fastest-growing health concerns globally. Early detection can prevent long-term health issues and save lives.

The motivation behind this project was:

- To build a complete **End-to-End Machine Learning pipeline**  
- To explore **model deployment using Django**  
- To apply **real-world machine learning workflows**  
- To work on a **socially beneficial healthcare project**
